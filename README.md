# computerquiz
A quiz where you get to guess computer terms in other languages!

This is a multi choice text based quiz where you select a language and then it tells you a computer term in that language and you have to select from four english words what that word might be.

Currently, I have implemented:
<ul>
<li>Maori</li>
<li>Spanish</li>
</ul>

I plan to implement more languages and allow for users to add their own languages.

It also lets users log in and save their scores which allows them to see statistics such as their top score and their overall average.
