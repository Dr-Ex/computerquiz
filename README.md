# computerquiz
A quiz where you get to guess computer terms in other languages!

This is a multi choice text based quiz where you select a language and then it tells you a computer term in that language and you have to select from four english words what that word might be.

Currently, I have implemented:
<ul>
<li>Maori</li>
<li>Spanish</li>
</ul>

I plan to implement more languages and allow for users to add their own languages.

It also lets users log in and save their scores which allows them to see statistics such as their top score and their overall average.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Python 3</li>
</ul>

<b>To start, run <span style="font-style:italic;">main.py</span></b>

To enter debug mode, type 975 at the difficulty select. This will display the answer to the question along with the question.

To see an example of the scores graph enter the username <span style="font-style:italic;">cheat</span> and password <span style="font-style:italic;">cheat</span> for an account with many random scores inserted into the database.
